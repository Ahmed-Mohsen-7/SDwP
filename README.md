This is my solution for first assignment in SDwP course. This repository contains:
1) main.py which contains four functions that can be decorated with four decorators. just undocument the decorator you want to use.
2) task1.py contains function decorator_1 that calculates the execution time and number of calls for the argument function.
3) task2.py contains function decorator_2 that prints function name, args, source code, ...etc
4) task3.py contains class decorator_3 that do the same as task 1,2 but write the output in output.txt
5) task4.py contains function decorator_4 that pipes error stream into log.txt instead of stdout
